# 📘 AI-Generated Study Summaries from Textbooks

### 🧠 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered summarization tool** that automatically generates **concise study summaries** from textbooks and academic materials.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, it helps students quickly understand key concepts by condensing large volumes of text into short, meaningful notes.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📚 **Text Extraction:** Reads and processes content from textbooks (PDF, DOCX, or scanned OCR files).  
- 🤖 **AI Summarization Engine:** Utilizes transformer-based models like **BERT**, **T5**, or **GPT** for context-aware summarization.  
- 🧩 **Custom Summary Levels:** Choose between brief, medium, or detailed summaries.  
- 🧠 **Keyword Highlighting:** Detects and emphasizes important concepts, formulas, and terms.  
- 🖥️ **Smart Dashboard:** Simple and responsive interface to upload textbooks and view results.  
- 🧾 **Export Options:** Download summaries as PDF or text files.  
- 📝 **Quiz Mode:** Automatically generates short quiz questions from summaries (optional feature).
